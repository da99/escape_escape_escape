What is it?
====================

My way of escaping and sanitizing HTML.
This is very personal to me, so you won't
find it useful or flexible to meet your needs.


NPM Use:
=====================


    // npm install escape_escape_escape

    var E = require("escape_escape_escape").Sanitize.html;
    E("The <strong>brave</strong> and the <b>bold</b>.");

Rubygems Use:
=====================


    # gem install escape_escape_escape

    Escape_Escape_Escape.html my_html_string
    Escape_Escape_Escape.text my_text_string
