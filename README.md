Escape_Escape_Escape
====================

My way of escaping and sanitizing HTML.
This is very personal to me, so you won't
find it useful or flexible to meet your needs.


Rubygems Use:
=====================

    # gem install escape_escape_escape

    Escape_Escape_Escape.html my_html_string
    Escape_Escape_Escape.text my_text_string

NOTE: Node and NPM Use:
=====================

This is no longer a npm module.
